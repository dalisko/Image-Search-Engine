# Image-Search-Engine

This is the final project of the Applied Machine Learning course taught during the fall of 2019 at Cornell Tech by Dr. Nathan Kallus. The format of the project was a mock peer-reviewed conference. Students were asked to develop an algorithm, prepare a professional paper, submit an anonymized version to the peer review system, and peer-review the work from other groups.

As a team, we proposed a way to search for relevant images given a natural language query. For instance, if a user types "dog jumping to catch frisbee," your system will rank-order the most relevant images from a large database.
